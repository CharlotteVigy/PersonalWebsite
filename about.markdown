# <u>Bio</u>

My name is Charlotte Vigy I’m a second-year computer science student at the University of Wisconsin who once had an offer to play D1 hockey but chose to follow my passion for tech instead. Trading the ice rink for the keyboard, I’ve dedicated myself to exploring the world of algorithms, AI, and creative coding projects. My journey from competitive sports to full-time studies has fueled my drive to push the limits of what’s possible in tech, and I’m always looking for new ways to innovate.

# <u>Pet Projects</u>

**[Bitcoin trading bot]()** - Python bot to automate daily Bitcoin purchases, leveraging APIs for real-time price tracking and executing small, routine buys based on market conditions. The bot optimizes my investment strategy by handling the tedious task of consistent crypto purchases, allowing me to dollar-cost average without manual intervention.
